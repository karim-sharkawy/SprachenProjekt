Hey there! I'm excited to share the code for my project, "Sprachen Projekt." This project generates a website featuring an interactive map complete with pointers. You can zoom in, move around, and toggle various features on the map. It encompasses every known language, including those that are extinct or endangered, along with outlines of their family origins and numerous other captivating features.

I created all python and JSON code, and you can freely use them for reference! I didn't personally develop the HTML, CSS, or JS code, although I did edit some of them. Credit for that goes to [@ajlkn](https://twitter.com/ajlkn), whose work I utilized. You can find all the files associated with his work in the "solid temp" folder. The result is stunning, and I'm grateful for his contribution. Moreover, the JS code for the map, 'map.js', is from [Amcharts](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/rotate-globe-to-a-selected-country/)

My motivations were:
+ Develope an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS code by experimenting and seeing what changes. Moreover, learning their syntax at a depper level
+ Develope experience parsing larger websites with more sophisticated HTML and multiple variables (including dealing with coordinate variables)
+ Learn frontend and backend development at a basic level.
+ Creating datasets and uutilizing them in the JS code (taking data from Ethnologue and displaying them on the map)
