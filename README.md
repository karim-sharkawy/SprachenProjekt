# Sprachen Karte
"Sprachen Karte", which means language map in German, is an Interactive Language Diversity Visualization Tool. It generates a website featuring an interactive map complete with pointers. You can zoom in, move around, and toggle various features on the map. It encompasses every known language, including those that are extinct or endangered, along with outlines of their family origins and numerous other captivating features. My objective was Language Diversity Visualization I want to build an interactive visualization tool that displays the geographical distribution of languages, their relationships, and linguistic diversity metrics like language families, dialect continua, and endangered languages. I plan to implement graphs, interactive elements to engage users, and smears of colors representing families.

Karim created all python and JSON code, and you can freely use them for reference! Thanks to [Rafee Adnan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/radnaan/) for helping with the JS and HTML code! He helped with the creation of parts like the overall design and map features. We didn't personally develop the original HTML, CSS, SCSS, or JS code, although we heavily edited some of them.  Credit for the creation of the files to [@ajlkn](https://twitter.com/ajlkn), whose work we utilized. The result is stunning, and I'm grateful for his contribution. Moreover, the JS code for the map, 'map.js', is from [Amcharts](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/zooming-to-countries-map/).

My motivations were:
+ Develope an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS code by experimenting and seeing what changes. Moreover, learning their syntax at a depper level.
+ Develope experience parsing larger websites with more sophisticated HTML and multiple variables (including dealing with coordinate variables).
+ Learn frontend and backend development at a basic level.
+ Creating datasets and uutilizing them in the JS code (taking data from Ethnologue and displaying them on the map).

**Ongoing tasks:**
1. Language Diversity
  - *Using D3.js, create visualizations of language family trees (families and relationships).*
  - *Implement interactive elements to explore relationships between languages.*
  - *Develop charts and graphs (using D3.js) to display metrics like number of speakers and endangerment status.*

2. Linking to Learning Resources
- **Resource Integration:** *Incorporate links to external learning resources for each language. This could include online courses, textbooks, apps, and websites.*
- **Information Pages:** *Create pages or modals that display additional information about each language, including learning resources, history, and usage.*
- *Links to more information and language learning resources.*
- *Include search functionality to find specific languages.*
